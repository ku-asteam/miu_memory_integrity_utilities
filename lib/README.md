# Static/Dynamic Library for Run-time Memory/Type Safety

> FRAMER: A Tagged-pointer Capability Model
 
aSTEAM Project https://asteam.korea.ac.kr

This includes hook functions for memory/type safety using 
runtime checks.

There are three main parts to MIU implementation: 
LLVM passes (/miu_memory_integrity_utilities/frame-pass2019/), 
and the static library (lib), and the binary lib in this directory. 
The target C source code and our hooksâ€™ functions in the static lib 
are first compiled to LLVM intermediate representation (IR). 
Our main transformation pass (/miu_memory_integrity_utilities/frame-pass2019/transformation)
instruments memory allocation/release, access, 
pointer arithmetic, or type cast in the target code in IR. 
The third part is wrappers around malloc family routines and string functions. 
Currently malloc, realloc, calloc, free (defined in mallocfamily.c) 
are interposed at compiler time,
but interposition at link-time is also possible 
(see wrappers_version2.c and lntpreprocess.sh).


## Requirements and Dependencies

(1) An UNIX-like Operating System
(2) clang/llvm version 4.0.0 or newer.

## Instructions

1. There are two modes of run-time checking: (1) bounds checking and 
   (2) type confusion checking. Changing modes requires SRC code
    modification (see ./framertypes.h and /frame-pass2019/trasformation/Framer.cpp). 
    Enable ENABLE_SPACEMIU to run on type checking mode.
2. Modify (if necessary) and execute a script, lntpreprocess.sh.
3. Modify (if necessary) and execute a script, spec.sh to build/run spaceMIU 
   e.g. with SPEC2000 benchmarks.
